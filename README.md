# Turtle-crossing-game

Turtle crossing game is a simple Python game using the Turtle graphics library and OOP (Object oriented programming).
In this game, you control a turtle trying to cross a busy road while avoiding oncoming cars. 
Your goal is to reach higher levels by succesfully crossing the road without getting hit by cars. The higher the level, the higher the speed of the car.

## Features

- **Player Control**: Control the turtle with the "Up" arrow key or "w" key to move upward.
- **Random Car Generation**: Cars are randomly generated on the road to create an unpredictable traffic flow.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your level, which increases every time you successfully cross the road.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the turtle collides with a car, and your final score is displayed.
- **Level Up**: After successfully crossing the road, the game gets more challenging as the level increases.
